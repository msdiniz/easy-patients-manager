# EasyPatientsManager TODO

## Features to Implement

### Patient Management

- [ ] **New Patient Button**:
  - Should only appear if the search text box has a valid name that has found zero correspondence in the patient list.
  - **Valid Name**: Any string that has at least two parts; at least two of the parts need to have three or more characters.
  - When clicked, should add a new patient to the list with the next ID (`id.max + 1`).

### Search Functionality

- [ ] **Clear Button**:
  - ~~Should appear anytime the search box has text.~~
  - ~~Clears the search box when clicked.~~
  - ~~When text is entered in search, ideally PatientInfo should get empty fullname and No Patient Select be displayed.~~
 
### Patient Details

- [ ] **Patient Details Tab**:
- ~~Should only appear if a patient is highlighted in the patient list.~~
- ~~Display patient details and allow editing.~~
- When I try to save a new patient: Patient saved: {id: 'f34c5s72q', fullName: "Testando Agora de Novo O'Liveira", dob: '2024-12-12', gender: 'Male', cpf: '789.012.345-66', â€¦} PatientDetails.tsx:54 Error loading detailed patient: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON PatientList does not receive new Patient
- When we try to edit patient, but dont do any changes (!Dirty) and we click in another patient, instead of PatientInfo, still PatientForm is displayed
- When we edit patient, and do changes (Dirty) and we click in another patient, we loose all changes
- Select is defaulting to the first value in a new patient! it should not assume any value but Date of First Contact should default to today

### UI Enhancements

- [ ] **Highlight Selected Patient**:
  - ~~Ensure the selected patient in the list is highlighted.~~

## Existing Requirements

- [x] **Basic CRUD Operations for Patients**

- [x] **Clinic Staff Fields**:
  - Full Name, Role (Physician, Admin, Supervisor), DOB, Gender, Emails, Addresses, Phones, Specialties (for Physicians).

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] **Patient and Staff Interaction**:
  - Implement interaction categories (e.g., first consultation, follow-up, urgent consultation, contact, hospitalization, admin).
  - Implement interaction details (e.g., category, location, time, price).
- [ ] **Integration with Google Contacts**:
  - Fetch patient details from Google Contacts.

## Notes

- Ensure all components are implemented in TypeScript.
- Use React for the frontend and plan for future integration with Electron for desktop application.
