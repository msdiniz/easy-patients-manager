# EasyPatientsManager TODO

## Features to Implement

### Patient Management

- [x] **New Patient Button**:
  - ~~Should only appear if the search text box has a valid name that has found zero correspondence in the patient list.~~
  - **Valid Name**: Any string that has at least two parts; at least two of the parts need to have three or more characters.
  - ~~When clicked, should add a new patient to the list with the next ID (`id.max + 1`).~~

### Search Functionality

- [x] **Clear Button**:
  - ~~Should appear anytime the search box has text.~~
  - ~~Clears the search box when clicked.~~
  - ~~When text is entered in search, ideally PatientInfo should get empty fullname and No Patient Select be displayed.~~

### Patient Details

- [x] **Patient Details Tab**:
  - ~~Should only appear if a patient is highlighted in the patient list.~~
  - ~~Display patient details and allow editing.~~
  - ~~When I try to save a new patient: Patient saved: {id: 'f34c5s72q', fullName: "Testando Agora de Novo O'Liveira", dob: '2024-12-12', gender: 'Male', cpf: '789.012.345-66', â€¦} PatientDetails.tsx:54 Error loading detailed patient: SyntaxError: Unexpected token '<', "<!doctype "... is not valid JSON PatientList does not receive new Patient~~
  - ~~When we try to edit patient, but dont do any changes (!Dirty) and we click in another patient, instead of PatientInfo, still PatientForm is displayed~~
  - ~~When we edit patient, and do changes (Dirty) and we lose all changes~~
  - ~~Select is defaulting to the first value in a new patient! it should not assume any value but Date of First Contact should default to today~~

## css styling
  - Understanding Class Name Handling in React with CSS Modules
CSS Modules and Class Names: CSS modules generate unique class names to avoid conflicts. These class names are often obfuscated (e.g., _formGroup_12pbc_25). When you combine class names, the order and presence of undefined can affect how styles are applied.

Combining Class Names: When combining class names, if any part of the combination is undefined, it can lead to unexpected results. React doesn't inherently handle undefined class names gracefully, so it's important to ensure that all class names are defined.
- npm install classnames


## Notes

- Ensure all components are implemented in TypeScript.
- Use React for the frontend and plan for future integration with Electron for desktop application.
